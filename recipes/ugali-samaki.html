        <li>In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and saut√© until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and bell pepper to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft.</li>
        <li>Stir in the turmeric powder, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for another minute to release the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add the fish fillets to the skillet, then pour in the coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Garnish the fish stew with fresh cilantro.</li>
        <li>Serve the fish stew hot with ugali on the side. Enjoy your traditional Ugali Samaki!</li>
